Also known as Henry, I am a philosopher, working mainly on the philosophy of language and early modern philosophy (especially David Hume), with additional interests in philosophy of emotion, aesthetics, metaethics, and descriptive metaphysics. I'm also interested in computer science and its applications in philosophy and the humanities more generally.

I am currently available for freelance or contract web development work. I specialize in Node and JavaScript, but can turn my hand to many things. See my [Portfolio](/portfolio) for details, and contact me through [GitHub]({{ site.github }}) or [LinkedIn]({{ site.linkedin }}).
