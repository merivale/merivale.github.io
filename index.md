Also known as Henry, I am a philosopher, working mainly on the philosophy of language and early modern philosophy (especially David Hume), with additional interests in philosophy of emotion, aesthetics, metaethics, and descriptive metaphysics. I'm also interested in computer science and its applications in philosophy and the humanities more generally.

My first book, [*Hume on Art, Superstition, and Emotion*](https://www.routledge.com/Hume-on-Art-Emotion-and-Superstition-A-Critical-Study-of-the-Four-Dissertations/Merivale/p/book/9781138351462), is now available from Routledge and all good booksellers. You can find a short sample from [this preview on Google Books](https://books.google.es/books?id=IjZ7DwAAQBAJ&pg).
