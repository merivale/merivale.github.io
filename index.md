Also known as Henry, I am a philosopher, working mainly on the philosophy of language and early modern philosophy (especially David Hume), with additional interests in philosophy of emotion, aesthetics, metaethics, and descriptive metaphysics. I'm also interested in computer science and its applications in philosophy and the humanities more generally, and I do some web development on the side.
