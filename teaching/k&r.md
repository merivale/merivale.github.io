## 102: Knowledge and Reality

As you can see, I am still working on this list. I offer eight topics on each half of the paper, so that you can focus entirely on one half if you wish. But it is a good idea to do at least two from each side.

### 1. Epistemology

- [The Definition of Knowledge](/assets/pdf/teaching/k&amp;r/The Definition of Knowledge.pdf)
- [Scepticism and the External World](assets/pdf/teaching/k&amp;r/Scepticism and the External World.pdf)
- [Contextualism](/assets/pdf/teaching/k&amp;r/Contextualism.pdf)
- Internalism versus Externalism
- Induction
- Testimony
- A Priori Knowledge
- Perception and Memory

### 2. Metaphysics

- Causation
- [Time and Tense](/assets/pdf/teaching/k&amp;r/Time and Tense.pdf)
- [Persistence and Change](assets/pdf/teaching/k&ramp;/Persistence and Change.pdf)
- Personal Identity
- Modality and Possible Worlds
- Properties and Universals
- Mereology
- The Metaphysics of Race
