      <p>In all compositions of genius, therefore, it is requisite, that the writer have some plan or object; and though he may be hurried from this plan by the vehemence of thought, as in an ode, or drop it carelessly, as in an epistle or essay, there must appear some aim or intention, in his first setting out, if not in the composition of the whole work. A production without a design would resemble more the ravings of a madman, than the sober efforts of genius and learning.</p>

  <h2>The History of the <i>Four Dissertations</i></h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>There are four short Dissertations, which I have kept some Years by me, in order to polish them as much as possible. One of them is that which Allan Ramsay mentiond to you. Another of the Passions; a third of Tragedy; a fourth, some Considerations previous to Geometry &amp; Natural Philosophy. The whole, I think, wou&rsquo;d make a Volume a fourth less than my Enquiry; as nearly as I can calculate: But it wou&rsquo;d be proper to print it in a larger Type, in order to bring it to the same Size &amp; Price. I wou&rsquo;d have it publish&rsquo;d about the new Year; I offer you the Property for fifty Guineas, payable at the Publication. You may judge, by my being so moderate in my Demands, that I do not propose to make any Words about the Bargain. It wou&rsquo;d be more convenient for me to print here; especially one of the Dissertations, where there is a good deal of Literature, but as the Manuscript is distinct &amp; accurate, it wou&rsquo;d not be impossible for me to correct it, tho&rsquo; printed at London. I leave it to your Choice; tho&rsquo; I believe, that it might be as cheaply &amp; conveniently &amp; safely executed here. However, the Matter is pretty near indifferent to me.</p>

  <h2>The History of the <i>Four Dissertations</i></h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I am told by a Friend, that Dr Millar said to him, there was a Bookseller in London, who had advertised a new Book, containing, among other things, two of my suppress&rsquo;d Essays. These I suppose are two Essays of mine, one on Suicide another on the Immortality of the Soul, which were printed by Andrew Millar about seventeen Years ago, and which from my abundant Prudence I suppress&rsquo;d and woud not now wish to have revived. I know not if you were acquainted with this Transaction. It was this: I intended to print four Dissertations, the natural History of Religion, on the Passions, on Tragedy, and on the metaphysical Principles of Geometry. I sent them up to Mr Millar, but before the last was printed, I happend to meet with Lord Stanhope, who was in this Country, and he convincd me, that either there was some Defect in the Argument or in its perspicuity; I forget which; and I wrote to Mr Millar, that I would not print that Essay; but upon his remonstrating that the other Essays woud not make a Volume, I sent him up these two, which I had never intended to have publishd. They were printed; but it was no sooner done than I repented; and Mr Millar and I agreed to suppress them at common Charges, and I wrote a new Essay on the Standard of Taste, to supply their place.</p>

  <h2>The Unity of the <i>Four Dissertations</i></h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hume had&hellip; originally envisaged a different collection of essays, and it seems unlikely that he had a philosophical vision that integrally linked geometry, religion, and the passions. Any integrity he might have envisioned, at some point in its history of shifting contents, could have been a consequence of fortuitous circumstances.</p>

    <h4>However</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>It is only <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i> that was a late addition.</li>
      <li>Nothing suggests that Hume didn&rsquo;t initially conceive of the first three as a coherent set.</li>
      <li>Nor is there anything to suggest that he didn&rsquo;t then write <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i> with the other three in mind.</li>
      <li>The links even extend to the abandoned dissertation on geometry&hellip;</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Geometry and the Passions</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The abandoned dissertation on geometry presumably included a reworking of <i>Treatise</i> Book 1, part 2, <i>Of the ideas of space and time</i>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <p>Book 2 of the <i>Treatise</i> contains two substantial sections (3,700 words) discussing the influence of space and time on the passions.</p>
    <p>In the <i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, these two sections are reduced to just a single sentence: <q>What is distant, either in place or time, has not an equal influence [on the passions] with what is near and contiguous</q> (P 6.18).</p>

  <h2>A Wild Conjecture</h2>

    <p>The abandoned dissertation on geometry included (an abridged version of) the discussion of the influence of space and time on the passions.</p>

    <h4>Was there room?</h4>
    <p>Hume said the original four <q>wou&rsquo;d make a Volume a fourth less than my Enquiry; as nearly as I can calculate</q>.</p>
    <p>The moral <i>Enquiry</i> (1753) was 275 pages long. The first three dissertations, as published in 1757, were 209 pages in the same type.</p>
    <p><i>Of Suicide</i> and <i>Of the Immortality of the Soul</i> are 6,620 words long. <i>Of the Standard of Taste</i> is 7,759 words long.</p>
    <p><i>Treatise</i> Book 1, part 2 is over 15,000 words long. The Book 2 material on geometry is around 3,700 words long.</p>

  <h2>The Standard of Taste</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is natural for us to seek a <em>Standard of Taste</em>; a rule, by which the various sentiments of men may be reconciled; at least, a decision afforded, confirming one sentiment, and condemning another.</p>
      <p><cite>ST 6</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <blockquote>
      <p>[N]o sentiment represents what is really in the object. It only marks a certain conformity or relation between the object and the organs or faculties of the mind; and if that conformity did not really exist, the sentiment could never possibly have being. Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.</p>

      <p>[F]ew are qualified to give judgment on any work of art, or establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty&hellip; Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found, is the true standard of taste and beauty.</p>

    <h4>The Million-Dollar Question</h4>
    <p>What&rsquo;s so special about the true judges? Why should their sentiments set the standard for the rest of us?</p>

  <h2>The Science of Criticism</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>The subjects of the understanding and passions make a compleat chain of reasoning by themselves; and I was willing to take advantage of this natural division, in order to try the taste of the public. If I have the good fortune to meet with success, I shall proceed to the examination of <em>morals</em>, <em>politics</em>, and <em>criticism</em>; which will compleat this <em>Treatise of human nature</em>.</em></p>
      <p><cite>T Ad1739</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Men, in this country, have been so much occupied in the great disputes of <em>Religion</em>, <em>Politics</em>, and <em>Philosophy</em>, that they had no relish for the seemingly minute observations of grammar and criticism. And though this turn of thinking must have considerably improved our sense and our talent of reasoning; it must be confessed, that, even in those sciences above-mentioned, we have not any standard-book, which we can transmit to posterity: And the utmost we have to boast of, are a few essays towards a more just philosophy; which, indeed, promise well, but have not, as yet, reached any degree of perfection.</p>

  <h2>The Rules of Art</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Thus the hunt was on for the <em>rules of art</em>: general causal laws governing what features of art works give rise to which passions, and in particular which properties give rise to the positive sentimental responses.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <h4>Particularism: there are no rules</h4>
    <p>There is no <i>a priori</i> guarantee that a science of criticism, of the sort that Hume envisaged, will be possible. A science of this sort is concerned with uncovering general principles, but what if the relevant phenomena are simply too diverse to admit of any substantial generalizations?</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Hume against the Particularists</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>But though all the general rules of art are founded only on experience and on the observation of the common sentiments of human nature, we must not imagine, that, on every occasion, the feelings of men will be conformable to these rules. Those finer emotions of the mind are of a very tender and delicate nature, and require the concurrence of many favourable circumstances to make them play with facility and exactness, according to their general and established principles. The least exterior hindrance to such small springs, or the least internal disorder, disturbs their motion, and confounds the operation of the whole machine.</p>
      <p><cite>ST 10</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>The organs of internal sensation are seldom so perfect as to allow the general principles their full play, and produce a feeling correspondent to those principles. They either labour under some defect, or are vitiated by some disorder; and by that means, excite a sentiment, which may be pronounced erroneous.</p>
      <p><cite>ST 23</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Joint Verdict</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>If, in the sound state of the organ, there be an entire or a considerable uniformity of sentiment among men, we may thence derive an idea of the perfect beauty[.]</p>
      <p><cite>ST 12</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <p>If not, presumably, the Humean is forced to acknowledge particularism, to abandon the science of criticism, and to accept the relativist&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>
    <p>This, I take it, is the point of Hume&rsquo;s claim that the standard of taste consists of the <em>joint</em> verdict of the true judges: the standard is premised on the extent to which they agree.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>But Do the True Judges Agree?</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is hard to see why we should grant the assumption that the ideal critics will, even for the most part, converge.</p>
      <p><cite>Matthew Kieran</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>The principle weakness of Hume&rsquo;s account is his blithe optimism about the uniformity of response of his true judges.</p>

  <h2>The Test of Time</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <blockquote>
      <p>The same Homer, who pleased at Athens and Rome two thousand years ago, is still admired at Paris and at London. All the changes of climate, government, religion, and language, have not been able to obscure his glory&hellip; It appears then, that, amidst all the variety and caprice of taste, there are certain general principles of approbation or blame, whose influence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind.</p>
      <p><cite>ST 11-12</cite></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="card delayed">
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is sufficient for my purpose, if I have made it appear, that, in the production and conduct of the passions, there is a certain regular mechanism, which is susceptible of as accurate a disquisition, as the laws of motion, optics, hydrostatics, or any part of natural philosophy.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Outstanding Questions</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Are there other explanations for Homer&rsquo;s enduring fame?</li>
      <li>Paris and London are one thing, but how does Homer fare in Tokyo or Pyongyang?</li>
      <li>Could the <em>mere exposure</em> effect explain Homer&rsquo;s reputation?</li>
      <li>What about mere exposure to bad art?</li>
