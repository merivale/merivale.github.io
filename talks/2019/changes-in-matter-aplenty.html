    <h1>Division of the Subject (T 2.1.1)</h1>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>AS all the perceptions of the mind may be divided into <em>impressions</em> and <em>ideas</em>, so the impressions admit of another division into <em>original</em> and <em>secondary</em>. This division of the impressions is the same with that which I formerly made use of when I distinguish&rsquo;d them into impressions of <em>sensation</em> and <em>reflection</em>... Of the first kind are all the impressions of the senses, and all bodily pains and pleasures: Of the second are the passions, and other emotions resembling them.</p>
    <cite>T 2.1.1.1</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">The</em> reflective impressions may be divided into two kinds, <em>viz.</em> the calm and the violent. Of the first kind is the sense of beauty and deformity in action, composition, and external objects. Of the second are the passions of love and hatred, grief and joy, pride and humility...</p>
    <cite>T 2.1.1.2</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">When</em> we take a survey of the passions, there occurs a division of them into <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>. By direct passions I understand such as arise immediately from good or evil, from pain or pleasure. By indirect such as proceed from the same principles, but by the conjunction of other qualities. This distinction I cannot at present justify or explain any farther. I can only observe in general, that under the indirect passions I comprehend pride, humility, ambition, vanity, love, hatred, envy, pity, malice, generosity, with their dependants. And under the direct passions, desire, aversion, grief, joy, hope, fear, despair and security. I shall begin with the former.</p>
    <cite>T 2.1.1.4</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>After</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two classes or species, which are distinguished by their different degrees of force and vivacity. The less forcible and lively are commonly denominated <em class="sc">Thoughts</em> or <em class="sc">Ideas</em>. The other species want a name in our language, and in most others; I suppose, because it was not requisite for any, but philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general term or appellation. Let us, therefore, use a little freedom, and call them <em class="sc">Impressions</em>; employing that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual. By the term impression, then, I mean all our more lively perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire, or will.</p>
    <cite>E 2.3</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>After</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It seems a proposition, which will not admit of much dispute, that... it is impossible for us to <i>think</i> of any thing, which we have not antecedently <i>felt</i>, either by our external or internal senses...</p>
    <p>Since, therefore, external objects as they appear to the senses, give us no idea of power or necessary connexion ..., let us see, whether this idea be derived from reflection on the operations of our own minds, and be copied from any internal impression.</p>
    <cite>E 7.4, 7.9</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>After</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">Besides</em> those passions above-mentioned [desire, aversion, hope, and fear], which arise from a direct pursuit of good and aversion to evil, there are others which are of a more complicated nature, and imply more than one view or consideration. Thus <em>Pride</em> is a certain satisfaction in ourselves, on account of some accomplishment or possession, which we enjoy: <em>Humility</em>, on the other hand, is a dissatisfaction with ourselves, on account of some defect or infirmity.</p>
    <p><em>Love</em> or <em>Friendship</em> is a complacency in another, on account of his accomplishments or services: <em>Hatred</em>, the contrary.</p>

  <h3>Editing Book 2</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">But</em> custom not only gives a facility to perform any action, but likewise an inclination and tendency towards it, where it is not entirely disagreeable, and can never be the object of inclination. And this is the reason why custom encreases all <em>active</em> habits, but diminishes <em>passive</em>, according to the observation of a late eminent philosopher. The facility takes off from the force of the passive habits by rendering the motion of the spirits faint and languid. But as in the active, the spirits are sufficiently supported of themselves, the tendency of the mind gives them new force, and bends them more strongly to the action.</p>

These passions, properly speaking, produce good and evil, and proceed not from them, like the other affections.</p>

    <h1>The Double Relation Theory (T 2.1.2-10, T 2.2.1-3)</h1>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Men are vain of the beauty of their country, of their county, of their parish. Here the idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure. This pleasure is related to pride. The object or cause of this pleasure is, by the supposition, related to self, or the object of pride. By this double relation of impressions and ideas, a transition is made from the one impression to the other.</p>

Thus a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much discompos&rsquo;d and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred subjects of discontent, impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions; especially if he can discover these subjects in or near the person, who was the cause of his first passion.</p>

    <p>THE passions of <em class="sc">pride</em> and <em class="sc">humility</em> being simple and uniform impressions, &rsquo;tis impossible we can ever, by a multitude of words, give a just definition of them, or indeed of any of the passions.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&rsquo;TIS altogether impossible to give any definition of the passions of <em>love</em> and <em>hatred</em>; and that because they produce merely a simple impression, without any mixture or composition.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">The</em> second quality, which I discover in these passions [pride and humility]... is their sensations, or the peculiar emotions they excite in the soul, and which constitute their very being and essence.

    <p>[E]nvy is excited by some present enjoyment of another, which by comparison diminishes our idea of our own... The enjoyment, which is the object of envy, is commonly superior to our own.</p>
    <cite>T 2.2.8.12</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In these two sets of passion, there is an obvious distinction to be made between the <em>object</em> of the passion and its <em>cause</em>. The object of pride and humility is self: The cause of the passion is some excellence in the former case; some fault, in the latter. The object of love and hatred is some other person: The causes, in like manner, are either excellencies or faults.</p>
    <cite>P 2.3</cite>
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Effect or Part of the Cause?</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The first idea, that is presented to the mind, is that of the cause or productive principle. This excites the passion [of pride], connected with it; and that passion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of self. Here then is a passion plac&rsquo;d betwixt two ideas, of which the one produces it, and the other is produc&rsquo;d by it.</p>
    <cite>T 2.1.2.4</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In order to excite pride, there are always two objects we must contemplate, <em>viz.</em> the cause or that object which produces pleasure; and self, which is the real object of the passion.</p>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is another passion sometimes called <em>love</em>, but more properly <em>good will</em> or <em>charity</em>. There can be no greater argument to a man, of his own power, than to find himself able not only to accomplish his own desires, but also to <em>assist</em> other men in theirs: and this is that conception wherein consisteth <em>charity</em>.</p>
    <cite>Hobbes, Human Nature, chapter 9</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he nearer we search into human Nature, the more we shall be convinced, that the Moral Virtues are the Political Offspring which Flattery begot upon Pride.</p>

  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Pity, Malice, and Envy</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Compassion frequently arises, where there is no preceding esteem or friendship; and compassion is an uneasiness in the sufferings of another. It seems to spring from the intimate and strong conception of his sufferings; and our imagination proceeds by degrees, from the lively idea to the real feeling of another&rsquo;s misery.</p>
    <p>Malice and envy also arise in the mind without any preceding hatred or injury; though their tendency is exactly the same with that of anger and ill-will. The comparison of ourselves with others seems to be the source of envy and malice. The more unhappy another is, the more happy do we ourselves appear in our own conception.</p>

    <p><em class="sc">Among</em> these phænomena we may esteem it a very favourable one to our present purpose, that tho&rsquo; fame in general be agreeable, yet we receive a much greater satisfaction from the approbation of those, whom we ourselves esteem and approve of, than of those, whom we hate and despise... But if the mind received from any original instinct a desire of fame, and aversion to infamy, fame and infamy wou&rsquo;d influence us without distinction; and every opinion, according as it were favourable or unfavourable, wou&rsquo;d equally excite that desire or aversion.</p>

    <p>There are bodily wants or appetites, acknowledged by every one, which necessarily precede all sensual enjoyment, and carry us directly to seek possession of the object. Thus, hunger and thirst have eating and drinking for their end; and from the gratification of these primary appetites arises a pleasure, which may become the object of another species of desire or inclination, that is secondary and interested. In the same manner, there are mental passions, by which we are impelled immediately to seek particular objects, such as fame, or power, or vengeance, without any regard to interest; and when these objects are attained, a pleasing enjoyment ensues, as the consequence of our indulged affections. Nature must, by the internal frame and constitution of the mind, give an original propensity to fame, ere we can reap any pleasure from that acquisition, or pursue it from motives of self-love, and desire of happiness. If I have no vanity, I take no delight in praise: If I be void of ambition, power gives me no enjoyment: If I be not angry, the punishment of an adversary is totally indifferent to me.</p>

  <h3>1757: Oh no it isn&rsquo;t</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Our opinions of all kinds are strongly affected by society and sympathy, and it is almost impossible for us to support any principle or sentiment, against the universal consent of every one, with whom we have any friendship or correspondence. But of all our opinions, those, which we form in our own favour; however lofty or presuming; are, at bottom, the frailest, and the most easily shaken by the contradiction and opposition of others... Hence that strong love of fame, with which all mankind are possessed. It is in order to fix and confirm their favourable opinion of themselves, not from any original passion, that they seek the applauses of others.</p>

  <h3>The Doctrine of Liberty</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... this fanstasical system of liberty ... arguments against liberty or free-will ... the doctrine of liberty [is] absurd... in one sense, and unintelligible in any other.</p>
    <cite>T 2.3.1.15, T 2.3.1.18, T 2.3.2.1</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I hope, therefore, to make it appear, that all men have ever agreed in the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty... and that the whole controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words... But to proceed in this reconciling project... By liberty... we can only mean <em>a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will</em>; that is, if we chuse to remain at rest, we may; if we chuse to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one, who is not a prisoner and in chains.</p>

    <p><em class="sc">A passion</em> is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence, and contains not any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence or modification. When I am angry, I am actually possest with the passion, and in that emotion have no more a reference to any other object, than when I am thirsty, or sick, or more than five foot high. &rsquo;Tis impossible, therefore, that this passion can be oppos&rsquo;d by, or be contradictory to truth and reason; since this contradiction consists in the disagreement of ideas, consider&rsquo;d as copies, with those objects, which they represent.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em class="sc">We</em> may add to this a remark; that in matters of religion men take a pleasure in being terrify&rsquo;d, and that no preachers are so popular, as those who excite the most dismal and gloomy passions. In the common affairs of life, where we feel and are penetrated with the solidity of the subject, nothing can be more disagreeable than fear and terror; and &rsquo;tis only in dramatic performances and in religious discourses, that they ever give pleasure. In these latter cases the imagination reposes itself indolently on the idea; and the passion, being soften&rsquo;d by the want of belief in the subject, has no more than the agreeable effect of enlivening the mind, and fixing the attention.</p>

  <h3>During</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no passion of the human mind but what may arise from poetry; tho&rsquo; at the same time the <em>feelings</em> of the passions are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are when they arise from belief and reality. A passion, which is disagreeable in real life, may afford the highest entertainment in a tragedy, or epic poem. In the latter case it lies not with that weight upon us: It feels less firm and solid: And has no other than the agreeable effect of exciting the spirits, and rouzing the attention.</p>

    <p>There is, however, a diffculty in applying to the present subject, in its full extent, this solution, however ingenious and satisfactory it may appear. It is certain, that the same object of distress, which pleases in a tragedy, were it really set before us, would give the most unfeigned uneasiness; though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and indolence.</p>

    <p>The pathetic description of the butchery, made by <em class="sc">Verres</em> of the <em class="sc">Sicilian</em> captains, is a masterpiece of this kind: But I believe none will affirm, that the being present at a melancholy scene of that nature would afford any entertainment.

<section>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&rsquo;TIS easy to observe, that the passions, both direct and indirect, are founded on pain and pleasure, and that in order to produce an affection of any kind, &rsquo;tis only requisite to present some good or evil...</p>
    <p><em class="sc">When</em> good is certain or probable, it produces <em class="sc">Joy</em>. When evil is in the same situation there arises <em class="sc">Grief</em> or <em class="sc">Sorrow</em>.</p>
    <p><em class="sc">When</em> either good or evil is uncertain, it gives rise to <em class="sc">Fear</em> or <em class="sc">Hope</em>, according to the degrees of uncertainty on the one side or the other.</p>
    <p><em class="sc">Desire</em> arises from good consider&rsquo;d simply, and <em class="sc">Aversion</em> is deriv&rsquo;d from evil. The <em class="sc">Will</em> exerts itself, when either the good or the absence of the evil may be attain&rsquo;d by any action of the mind or body.</p>
    <p><em class="sc">Beside</em> good and evil, or in other words, pain and pleasure, the direct passions frequently arise from a natural impulse or instinct, which is perfectly unaccountable. Of this kind is the desire of punishment to our enemies, and of happiness to our friends; hunger, lust, and a few other bodily appetites. These passions, properly speaking, produce good and evil, and proceed not from them, like the other affections.</p>

    <p>SOME objects produce immediately an agreeable sensation, by the original structure of our organs, and are thence denominated <em class="sc">Good</em>; as others, from their immediate disagreeable sensation, acquire the appellation of <em class="sc">Evil</em>. Thus moderate warmth is agreeable and good; excessive heat painful and evil.</p>
    <p>Some objects again, by being naturally conformable or contrary to passion, excite an agreeable or painful sensation; and are thence called <em>Good</em> or <em>Evil</em>. The punishment of an adversary, by gratifying revenge, is good; the sickness of a companion, by affecting friendship, is evil...</p>
    <p>When good is certain or probable, it produces <em class="sc">Joy</em>. When evil is in the same situation, there arises <em class="sc">Grief</em> or <em class="sc">Sorrow</em>.</p>
