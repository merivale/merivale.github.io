  <h2>The passions of animals (T 2.1.12, T 2.2.12)</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALL our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a species of <em class="sc">Analogy</em>, which leads us to expect from any cause the same events, which we have observed to result from similar causes. ... The anatomical observations, formed upon one animal, are, by this species of reasoning, extended to all animals; and it is certain, that when the circulation of the blood, for instance, is clearly proved to have place in one creature, as a frog, or fish, it forms a strong presumption, that the same principle has place in all. These analogical observations may be carried farther, even to this science, of which we are now treating; and any theory, by which we explain the operations of the understanding, or the origin and connexion of the passions in man, will acquire additional authority, if we find, that the same theory is requisite to explain the same ph√¶nomena in all other animals.</p>
