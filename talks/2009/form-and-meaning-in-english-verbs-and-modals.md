# Form and Meaning in English Verbs and Modals

### Amyas Merivale

### Leeds Postgraduate Seminar<br>20th November 2009

</section><section>

## Introduction

English discourse comes in clauses.

Finite clauses contain a finite form of a verb or modal at the fulcrum:

- Robert <u>is</u> awake.
- Robert <u>can</u>'t sleep.
- Robert <u>might</u> get out of bed.
- Terry <u>went</u> to the shops.
- Julie <u>will</u> be home soon.

</section><section>

## Introduction

Finite forms of both verbs and modals divide cleanly into two kinds, which I will label the A form and the B form:

| *verbs:* | **be**            | **have**      | **do**       | **go**       |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A form   | *am*, *is*, *are* | *have*, *has* | *do*, *does* | *go*, *goes* |
| B form   | *was*, *were*     | *had*         | *did*        | *went*       |

| *modals:* | **will**   | **shall**   | **can**   | **may**   |
| --------- | -----------| ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| A form    | *will*     | *shall*     | *can*     | *may*     |
| B form    | *would*    | *should*    | *could*   | *might*   |

</section><section>

## Introduction

Clearly, the A form of the verb sometimes signifies present time, with the B form signifying past time:

- Robert <u>is</u> awake (at the moment).
- Robert <u>was</u> awake (yesterday).

<div class="delayed">
But what about the following examples?

- Terry and Julie <u>are</u> getting married next year.
- Terry and Julie <u>were</u> getting married next year.
- If Robert <u>gets</u> out of bed (ten minutes from now), ...
- If Robert <u>got</u> out of bed (ten minutes from now), ...
</div>

## Introduction

Furthermore, it is often supposed that 'will' signifies future time, as in:

- It <u>will</u> be sunny in Paris tomorrow.
- Julie <u>will</u> be home soon.

<div class="delayed">
But what about the following clauses?

- It <u>will</u> be sunny in Paris right now.
- It <u>will</u> have been sunny in Paris yesterday.
- These days, Robert <u>will</u> often be found in the library.
</div>

## Introduction

**So:**

*What is the significance of the A and B forms of the English verbs and modals?*

<div class="delayed">
Our options are:

1. offer a unified temporal account (and explain away the apparent counterexamples)
2. offer an ambiguous account (and explain the significance of the forms in all the different cases)

I believe (1) is the right course. I will go partway to defending it here.

## Part 1: Verbs

The unified temporal account for verbs:

- The A form of the verb always signifies present time.
- The B form of the verb always signifies past time.

Obviously anyone who defends this account must have something to say about its *prima facie* counterexamples.

## Part 1: Verbs

Futurate Predication:

- Terry and Julie <u>are</u> getting married next year.
- The sun <u>sets</u> at 7.03 tomorrow.

<div class="delayed">
- Terry and Julie <u>were</u> getting married next year.
- Terry and Julie <u>were</u> getting married next year, but there was a double booking at the church, and now it's had to be postponed.
</div>

## Part 1: Verbs

An absolutely crucial distinction between:

**Time Signified by Form**

and

**Time About**

</section><section>

## Part 1: Verbs

Subordinate clauses (1):

- Terry and Julie are getting married next year, as long as her father <u>does</u> not object.

**NOT**: As long as her father does not object: *Prearrangement*: Get married next year.

**BUT**: *Prearrangement:* As long as her father does not object: Get married next year.

## Part 1: Verbs

Subordinate clauses (2):

- If he <u>stops</u> drinking, Terry will make a fine husband for Julie.
- If he <u>stopped</u> drinking, Terry would make a fine husband for Julie.

This is the 'forward time-shift phenomenon' (Bennet, 2003), first noted by Allan Gibbard (1981). Our present question has a direct bearing on the semantics of 'if', a hotbed of philosophical debate.

The explanation...?

# <u>Part 2:</u>

# Modals

</section><section>

## Part 2: Modals

Clearly, the A and B forms of the modals sometimes signify present time and past time respectively, just like verbs:

- Robert <u>can</u>'t sleep (at the moment).
- Robert <u>could</u>n't sleep (yesterday).

- (These days,) Robert <u>will</u> often / <u>can</u> sometimes, <u>may</u> occasionally be found in the library.
- (In those days,) Robert <u>would</u> often / <u>could</u> sometimes, <u>might</u> occasionally be found in the library.

</section><section>

## Part 2: Modals

The unified temporal account for modals:

- The A form of the modal always signifies present time.
- The B form of the modal always signifies past time.

<div class="delayed">
An opposing claim (the future tense hypothesis):

'Will' sometimes signifies future time, so that 'will be' (in such cases) says of the future exactly what 'is' and 'was' say of the present and past respectively.
</div>

</section><section>

## Part 2: Modals

*Does 'will' ever signify futurity? (1/2)*

Motivation 1: 'will' turns up in clauses that are clearly about the future.

- It <u>will</u> be sunny in Paris tomorrow.
- Terry <u>will</u> make a fine husband for Julie.

<div class="delayed">
**BUT:** As we have seen, *time signified by form* is not necessarily identical to the time a message is intuitively *about*.
</div>

</section><section>

## Part 2: Modals

*Does 'will' ever signify futurity? (2/2)*

Motivation 2: there must be some way to say about the future what we can say about the present and the past, and the things we say about the future with 'will' look like the best candidates.

<div class="delayed">
**BUT:** Whether we can say about the future exactly what we can say about the present and the past is a *contingent matter*. It is to be settled by the empirical evidence alone, not by *a prior* intuitions about what should or must be sayable in a language.
</div>

</section><section>

## Part 2: Modals

The evidence:

**THESIS:** In reported speech, we change the words in order to preserve the objective substance of what is said. Thus:

- *Robert:* <span class="red">I</span> <span class="blue">am</span> awake.
- *Terry:* Robert said that <span class="red">he</span> <span class="blue">was</span> awake.

<div class="delayed">
But observe:

- *Robert:* <span class="red">I</span> <span class="blue">will be</span> in York tomorrow.
- *Terry:* Robert said that <span class="red">he</span> <span class="blue">would be</span> in York today.
</div>

</section><section class="centred">

## Part 2: Modals

The unified temporal hypothesis:

**the A form of every English verb or modal always signifies present time**

and

**the B form of every English verb or modal always signifies past time**
